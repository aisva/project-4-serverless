# The TODO application
TODO is a cloud application that allows users to register and log into a web client where they can see a list of their pending tasks, create new ones, update them, delete them or attach an image to them. It is the fourth project of Udacity's [Cloud Developer Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/cloud-developer-nanodegree--nd9990).

The TODO application is split in two parts:
* A [RESTful API](https://github.com/aisva/project-4-serverless/tree/master/backend), entirely built with serverless technologies (AWS Lambda, AWS API Gateway, AWS DynamoDB and AWS S3) and developed with the [Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com).
* A [frontend application](https://github.com/aisva/project-4-serverless/tree/master/client), that provides a GUI to access the RESTful API.

# Monitoring
To demonstrate that the TODO application has sufficient monitoring, as required by the rubric of the fourth project of Udacity's [Cloud Developer Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/cloud-developer-nanodegree--nd9990), the following screenshots are provided (see [screenshots](https://github.com/aisva/project-4-serverless/tree/master/screenshots) folder):
* A screenshot that shows metrics generated by API Gateway.
* A screenshot that shows log groups generated by Lambda functions.
